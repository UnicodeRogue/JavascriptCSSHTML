   ‘All the world’s a stage,  <br>
   and all the men and women merely players. <br>
   They have their exits and their entrances; <br>
   And one man in his time plays many parts.</p>

      “O serpent heart hid with a flowering face!<br>
Did ever a dragon keep so fair a cave?<br>
Beautiful tyrant, feind angelical, dove feather raven, wolvish-ravening lamb! <br>
Despised substance of devinest show, just opposite to what thou justly seemest <br>
A dammed saint, an honourable villain!” </p>

      “Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,<br>
Is the immediate jewel of their souls:<br>
Who steals my purse steals trash; ’tis something, nothing;<br>
’twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands;<br>
But he that filches from me my good name<br>
Robs me of that which not enriches him,<br>
And makes me poor indeed.” .</p>

“To be, or not to be: that is the question: <br>
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer <br>
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, <br>
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, <br>
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; <br>
No more; and by a sleep to say we end <br>
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks <br>
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation <br>
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; <br>
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; <br>
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come <br>
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, <br>
Must give us pause: there's the respect <br>
That makes calamity of so long life; <br>
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, <br>
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, <br>
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, <br>
The insolence of office and the spurns <br>
That patient merit of the unworthy takes, <br>
When he himself might his quietus make <br>
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear, <br>
To grunt and sweat under a weary life, <br>
But that the dread of something after death, <br>
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn <br>
No traveller returns, puzzles the will <br>
And makes us rather bear those ills we have <br>
Than fly to others that we know not of? <br>
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all; <br>
And thus the native hue of resolution <br>
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, <br>
And enterprises of great pith and moment <br>
With this regard their currents turn awry, <br>
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now! <br>
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons <br>
Be all my sins remember'd!”
